# AST-Angular-Node-Bootstrap
This is my project from college, there i'm using some technologies like these in the name of the repository and among others, to create an catalog of pending tasks and tasks already done, the user may create them and exclude them as he pleases. They are stored on localhost and latter will be on a mock database, which makes room for a real database to join it.


The modules are not included on this project, you will need to install them with "npm-install" for running (npm-start).
